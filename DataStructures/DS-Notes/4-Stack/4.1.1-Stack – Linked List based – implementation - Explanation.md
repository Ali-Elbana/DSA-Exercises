### What is a Stack?

A stack is a fundamental data structure characterized by a specific order of operation: **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)**. Imagine a container where items are placed on top of one another.

- **Adding Data**: Data is added to the container from **one direction**, stacking on top of previous elements.
- **Accessing Data**: You can only **read the top data**. To access or read any other data, the data currently at the top must first be removed.

### Stack Infrastructure and Operations

A stack can be implemented using different underlying data structures, commonly an **Array or a Linked List**. The C++ implementation provided uses a **Linked List as its underlying data structure**.

Key operations associated with a stack include:

- **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Removes the top element from the stack.
- **Peek**: Retrieves the top element without removing it.
- **isEmpty**: Checks if the stack contains any elements.
- **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
- **Print**: Displays all elements in the stack.
- **Clear**: Removes all elements from the stack.

### C++ Stack Implementation Details

This C++ implementation [[4.1.2-Stack – Linked List based – implementation - Code#Complete Code Implementation]] is a **self-implementation of a stack based on a linked list**, primarily for educational purposes. It is a **template class `Stack<T>`**, meaning it can work with various data types (e.g., integers, strings, characters).

The `Stack` class privately holds an instance of a `LinkedList<T>` named `list`, which manages the actual data storage.

**Core Stack Operations in the C++ Implementation:**

- **`push(const T& value)`**: When an element is pushed onto the stack, it is added to the beginning of the underlying linked list using `list.insertFirst(value)`. This makes the head of the linked list the "top" of the stack.
- **`pop()`**: To remove an element from the stack, the `pop` method checks if the stack is empty. If it's not empty, it removes the first element of the linked list by calling `list.deleteHead()`. If the stack is empty, it outputs a message indicating that it cannot pop.
- **`peek() const`**: This method allows you to view the top element without removing it. It checks if the stack is empty; if not, it returns the first element of the linked list using `list.getFirst()`. If the stack is empty, it indicates that it cannot peek and returns a default-constructed value of the type `T`.

**Utility Methods in the C++ Implementation:**

- **`isEmpty() const`**: Returns `true` if the underlying linked list is empty, `false` otherwise.
- **`size() const`**: Returns the number of elements in the stack by calling `list.getLength()`.
- **`print() const`**: If the stack is empty, it prints a message. Otherwise, it prints the stack contents from top to bottom by calling `list.printList()`.
- **`clear()`**: Empties the stack by calling `list.clear()`.

**Constructors, Assignment, and Destructor:** The `Stack` class includes a default constructor, a copy constructor, a copy assignment operator, and a destructor. These largely delegate their operations to the corresponding methods of the internal `LinkedList` object. For instance, the `Stack` destructor automatically handles cleanup because the `LinkedList` destructor manages its own memory.

The `main` application includes tests for various data types, demonstrating the stack's functionality with integers, strings, and characters.
