## Data & Memory in Programming

This note explores how data is represented and stored in computer memory, focusing on concepts like binary representation, memory addresses, pointers, and the distinction between the Memory Stack and Memory Heap.

### 1. Data Representation and Memory Addresses

Numbers are stored in binary format in memory. The amount of memory allocated depends on the data type, which in turn determines the number of bits used.

- **16-bit Integer:** A value like `1520` can be stored as a 16-bit binary number (`00000101 11100000`).
    - This typically occupies two memory locations (e.g., `0x5040E8` and `0x5040E9`), with each location holding 8 bits (a byte).
- **32-bit Integer:** The same value `1520` can also be stored as a 32-bit binary number (`00000000 00000000 00000101 11100000`).
    - This would occupy four memory locations (e.g., `0x5040E8` through `0x5040EB`).
- Programming languages like Golang, Java, and C# provide different integer types (e.g., `int16`, `short`, `Int16`, `int`, `Int32`) to declare variables that occupy specific amounts of memory.

### 2. Pointers

A **pointer is a Data Type**.

- It **holds an address for a variable**.
- The address refers to the **index of the memory location in the memory matrix**.

For example, if `Int32 num = 1520;` is declared, the value `1520` is stored at a specific memory address (e.g., `0x5040E8`). A pointer variable, like `Int32 *ptr = &num;`, would then store the _address_ of `num` (e.g., `0x5040E8`) at its own memory location (e.g., `0x5040EC`).

### 3. Memory Stack

The **Memory Stack** is a region of memory.

[![DataTypes](G:\DSA\Slides\DataTypes\s6.png)

- It is used for storing **local variables** and **function call frames**.
- When a function (like `PrintNumber` in the C# example) is called, its parameters and local variables (`num`, `str`) are pushed onto the stack.
- Each new call to the same function, even recursively, creates a new set of local variables on the stack.
- As functions return, their respective stack frames and local variables are removed.

### 4. Memory Heap

The **Memory Heap** is another region of memory.

[![DataTypes](G:\DSA\Slides\DataTypes\s13.png)

- It is primarily used for **dynamic memory allocation**, specifically for storing **objects** created using the `new` keyword.
- When an object (e.g., `Nums num = new Nums();`) is instantiated, the actual `num object` resides in the Heap (e.g., at `0x6152EA`).
- A variable in the stack (e.g., at `0x5040EB`) typically stores the memory address (a pointer) to this object in the Heap (`0x6152EA`), acting as a reference.

### 5. Stack & Heap Are Not Data Structures

It's important to note that **Memory Stack & Heap are NOT Data Structures**. They are "just regular places in the memory treated differently". While they share names with the abstract data structures "stack" and "heap", in the context of memory management, they refer to specific _regions_ of memory with distinct allocation and deallocation behaviors.
