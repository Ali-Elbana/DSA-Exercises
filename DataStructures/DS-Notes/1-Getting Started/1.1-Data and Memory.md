## **Data Structures: Decoding Data & Memory**

**Introduction** This note provides an introductory look into **Data Structures** with a focus on **Data & Memory**. It explores how data is stored, measured, and represented at a fundamental level within computer systems.

## **Understanding Data & Memory**

- **Physical Representation of Memory**: Memory, such as RAM (Random Access Memory) and hard drives, physically stores data. At a microscopic level, memory involves intricate chip designs, containing components like DRAM Capacitors and transistors.
- **The Bit - Fundamental Unit**: The smallest unit of data is a **bit**, which can be either **0 or 1**.
    - A memory cell is considered '1' if there is an electrical current stored within it.
    - A memory cell is considered '0' if there is no electrical current within it.
    - These 0s and 1s are physically represented by the state of tiny electrical circuits, often involving logic gates like XOR gates, which can be as small as 10 nanometers.
- **Memory Addressing**: Each piece of data stored in memory has an **address** and a **value**. For example, an address like `0x5040E8` can point to a binary value such as `00110101`. Memory can be viewed as a grid of addresses, each capable of holding a certain amount of data, such as 8-bit values.

**Units of Information** Data is measured in various units based on multiples of bits:

- **Bit**: The smallest unit, representing 0 or 1.
- **Byte**: Consists of 8 bits.
- **Kilobyte**: Equals 1024 Bytes (or 8,192 bits).
- **Megabyte**: Equals 1024 Kilobytes (or 8,388,608 bits).
- **Gigabyte**: Equals 1024 Megabytes (or 8,589,934,592 bits).
- Larger units include Terabyte, Petabyte, Exabyte, Zettabyte, Yottabyte, and so on.

## **Binary Representation and Conversion**

Any type of data can be converted into a binary value.

- **Decimal to Binary Conversion (Example: 1520)**: To convert a decimal number to binary, one method involves repeatedly dividing the decimal number by 2 and recording the remainder.
    
    - 1520 / 2 = 760 remainder 0
    - 760 / 2 = 380 remainder 0
    - 380 / 2 = 190 remainder 0
    - 190 / 2 = 95 remainder 0
    - 95 / 2 = 47 remainder 1
    - 47 / 2 = 23 remainder 1
    - 23 / 2 = 11 remainder 1
    - 11 / 2 = 5 remainder 1
    - 5 / 2 = 2 remainder 1
    - 2 / 2 = 1 remainder 0
    - 1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1 Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives the binary representation: **10111100000**. If the resulting binary value is shorter than the required memory storage length (e.g., 16 bits), leading zeros are added to the left.
- **Binary to Decimal Conversion (Example: 10111100000)**: To convert a binary number back to decimal, each digit is multiplied by a power of 2, corresponding to its position (starting from 2^0 for the rightmost digit), and the results are summed.
    
    - 1 * 2^10 (1024) = 1024
    - 0 * 2^9 (512) = 0
    - 1 * 2^8 (256) = 256
    - 1 * 2^7 (128) = 128
    - 1 * 2^6 (64) = 64
    - 1 * 2^5 (32) = 32
    - 1 * 2^4 (16) = 16
    - 0 * 2^3 (8) = 0
    - 0 * 2^2 (4) = 0
    - 0 * 2^1 (2) = 0
    - 0 * 2^0 (1) = 0 Summing these values (1024 + 0 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0) yields **1520**.

## **Converting Different Data Types to Binary**

- **Text**: Text is converted to binary using encoding standards.
    
    - **ASCII** (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a common encoding that assigns a unique decimal (and thus binary) value to each character (letters, numbers, symbols). For instance, 'D' corresponds to decimal 68, 'a' to 97, etc..
    - **Unicode** is a more comprehensive encoding system that supports a wider range of characters from various languages. Common Unicode encodings include **UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32**.
    - **Example: Converting "Data Structures" to Binary using ASCII**: The word "Data Structures" can be broken down into individual characters, each assigned a decimal value by ASCII, and then converted to binary.
        - D: 68 (01000100)
        - a: 97 (01100001)
        - t: 116 (01110100)
        - a: 97 (01100001)
        - ...and so on for the rest of the characters, resulting in a long string of binary digits.
- **Colors**: Colors are often represented using **RGB** (Red, Green, Blue) values, where each component (Red, Green, Blue) has a numerical intensity, or by **Hex Color Codes**. These numerical values are then converted to binary.
    
    - For example, Red is (255, 0, 0) in RGB, which is #FF0000 in Hex.
    - A specific color like #BF5E05 in Hex corresponds to the binary sequence 101111110101111000000101.
- **Images**: Images are composed of **pixels**, and each pixel has color data. This color data (e.g., RGB or Hex) is converted into binary information. For example, an image that is 1280 pixels wide by 720 pixels high will have the color data for each of its many pixels stored as binary.
