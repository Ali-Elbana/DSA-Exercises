## C++ Single Linked List Implementation: Structure and Core Operations

This note details the self-implementation of a **single linked list in C++**, designed for educational purposes to enhance understanding of data structures. It covers the fundamental components, their memory allocation, and key operations like insertion and element access.

### 1. Project Context and Includes

The project is titled "Single Linked List Implementation". The primary source file is `SLinkedList.cpp`. It includes standard C++ headers such as `<iostream>` for input/output and `<string>`. Namespace usage explicitly includes `std::cout`, `std::cin`, and `std::endl`.

**The code reference:** [[3.1.2-Introduction â€“ Singly list implementation - Code#Complete Code Implementation]]

### 2. Linked List Fundamentals

A Linked List is characterized by its **non-consecutive memory stores**. Unlike arrays, its elements are not stored adjacently in memory.

- **Visual Representation**: A linked list consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node points to the next. For example, `node1` contains `data: 1` and `next: *node2`. The last node points to `null`.
- **Memory Allocation**: Nodes are typically allocated in the **memory Heap**, while their addresses might be referenced from the Stack. For instance, a `node address` in the Stack (e.g., `0x5040F0`) points to the `node data` in the Heap (e.g., `0x6152EA`).

### 3. Class Structure

The implementation involves two primary classes: `Node` and `LinkedList`.

#### 3.1. `Node` Class

The `Node` class represents an individual element within the linked list.

- **Attributes**:
    - `data`: An integer (`int`) to store the value of the node.
    - `next`: A pointer (`Node *`) to the next node in the sequence. This pointer holds the address of the subsequent node.
- **Constructor**: The constructor `Node(int val)` initializes `data` with the provided `val` and sets `next` to `nullptr`.

#### 3.2. `LinkedList` Class

The `LinkedList` class manages the collection of `Node` objects, representing the entire list.

- **Attributes (Private)**:
    - `head`: A pointer (`Node *`) to the first node in the list.
    - `tail`: A pointer (`Node *`) to the last node in the list.
    - `length`: A `size_t` variable to keep track of the number of nodes in the list.
- **Constructor**: The default constructor `LinkedList()` initializes `head` and `tail` to `nullptr` and `length` to `0`.
- **Destructor**: The `~LinkedList()` destructor iterates through the list, starting from the `head`, and deallocates each node using `delete tmp` until `head` becomes `nullptr`. This prevents memory leaks.

### 4. Key Operations/Methods Implemented

The `LinkedList` class provides several methods for manipulating the list:

#### 4.1. `insertLast(int val)`

- **Name**: `insertLast`.
- **Purpose**: To add a new node with a specified value (`val`) at the end of the list.
- **Inputs**: `val` (integer).
- **Processes/Logic**:
    1. A new `Node` is created with the given `val`.
    2. **Validation**: It checks if the `head` is `nullptr` (i.e., the list is empty).
    3. If the list is **empty**: Both `head` and `tail` are set to point to the `newNode`.
    4. If the list is **not empty**: The `next` pointer of the current `tail` is updated to point to the `newNode`, and then the `tail` itself is updated to be the `newNode`. The `newNode`'s `next` pointer is set to `nullptr`.
    5. The `length` of the list is incremented.
- **Outputs**: Returns nothing (`void`).

#### 4.2. `getAt(size_t idx)`

- **Name**: `getAt`.
- **Purpose**: To retrieve the `data` value of a node at a specific index (`idx`).
- **Inputs**: `idx` (a `size_t` representing the index).
- **Processes/Logic**:
    1. A `currNode` pointer is initialized to `head`.
    2. **Validation**: It checks if `idx` is greater than or equal to the current `length` of the list.
    3. If `idx` is out of range, it prints "Index out of range." (and implicitly, an uninitialized `currNode->data` will be returned in the provided C++ structure, which could be problematic without explicit error handling or returning a default value).
    4. If `idx` is valid: The method iterates through the list, moving `currNode` to `currNode->next` for `i` times until `i` equals `idx`.
- **Outputs**: Returns the `data` (integer) of the node at the specified index.

#### 4.3. `printList()`

- **Purpose**: To display all the elements of the linked list.
- **Processes/Logic**: It starts from the `head` and iterates through each `currNode`, printing its `data` followed by " --> " until `currNode` becomes `nullptr`, at which point it prints "NULL".

#### 4.4. `getLength(void)`

- **Purpose**: To get the current number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Outputs**: Returns the `length` (a `size_t`) of the list.

### 5. Other Linked List Operations

Beyond the implemented methods, a comprehensive `LinkedList` structure typically supports a range of operations:

- **Infrastructure**: Independent and non-consecutive memory stores.
- **Operations**:
    - `get length`
    - `traverse`
    - `find`
    - `insert first`
    - `delete first`
    - `insert last`
    - `delete last`
    - `insert after`
    - `insert before`
    - `delete node`
    - `findParent`
    - `sum`
    - C++ Standard Library List Operations: `begin`, `end`, `empty`, `size`, `front`, `back`, `insert`, `swap`, `merge`, `sort`, `reverse`.

### 6. Main Application Example

The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `LinkedList` class.

- It initializes a `LinkedList` object named `list`.
- It inserts elements `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` to the list using `list.insertLast()`.
- It then calls `list.printList()` to display the contents.
- Finally, it retrieves and prints the length of the linked list using `list.getLength()`. The output would show `1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> NULL` and "The linked list length = 4".
