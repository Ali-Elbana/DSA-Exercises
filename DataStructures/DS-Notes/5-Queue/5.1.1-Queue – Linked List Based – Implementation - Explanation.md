### Queue Implementation Overview

This note details a self-implementation of a Queue data structure based on a Linked List in C++. This implementation is designed for educational purposes.

**1. What is a Queue?**

- A Queue is a data structure that operates on a **"First In, First Out" (FIFO)** principle. This means the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.
- Data is conceptually added to one end (data in) and removed from the other end (data out).

**2. Underlying Infrastructure:**

- This particular Queue implementation uses a **Generic Linked List** (`LinkedList<T>`) as its underlying data structure. The Queue class contains a private member `list` of type `LinkedList<T>`.
- Other possible infrastructures for a Queue include an Array.

**3. Key Queue Operations (Public Methods):** The `Queue` class provides the following core operations and utility methods:

- **`enqueue(const T& value)`**:
    - Adds an element (`value`) to the end of the Queue.
    - Internally, this method calls `list.insertLast(value)` on the underlying linked list.
- **`dequeue()`**:
    - Removes and returns the element from the front (top) of the Queue.
    - If the Queue is empty, it prints a message and returns a default-constructed value.
    - Internally, it retrieves the first element using `list.getFirst()` and then removes it using `list.deleteHead()`.
- **`peek() const`**:
    - Returns the element at the front (top) of the Queue without removing it.
    - If the Queue is empty, it prints a message and returns a default-constructed value.
    - Internally, it calls `list.getFirst()`.
- **`isEmpty() const`**:
    - Checks if the Queue is empty.
    - Internally, it calls `list.isEmpty()` on the linked list.
- **`size() const`**:
    - Returns the number of elements currently in the Queue.
    - Internally, it calls `list.getLength()`.
- **`print() const`**:
    - Prints all elements in the Queue, from top to bottom.
    - If the Queue is empty, it prints a corresponding message.
    - Internally, it calls `list.printList()`.
- **`clear()`**:
    - Removes all elements from the Queue.
    - Internally, it calls `list.clear()`.

**4. Constructors, Assignment Operator, and Destructor:** The `Queue` class also includes standard C++ features for proper object management:

- **Default Constructor (`Queue()`):** Initializes the internal `LinkedList`.
- **Copy Constructor (`Queue(const Queue<T>& other)`):** Performs a deep copy of the `LinkedList` from another Queue object.
- **Copy Assignment Operator (`operator=(const Queue<T>& other)`):** Handles assignment between Queue objects, ensuring self-assignment is avoided and the list is copied.
- **Destructor (`~Queue()`):** The `LinkedList` destructor automatically handles the cleanup of allocated memory.

---
**5. Implementation Details and Generic Nature:**

- The Queue is implemented as a **template class (`template<typename T> class Queue`)**, allowing it to store elements of any data type (e.g., integers, strings, characters).
- The `Queue-LList.cpp` file includes necessary headers like `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<string>`, and `"GS-LList.cpp"`, suggesting that the generic linked list implementation is provided in `GS-LList.cpp`.

---
**6. Testing:**

- The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `Queue` class by calling a `testQueueOperations` template function.
- The `testQueueOperations` function tests the Queue with different data types:
    - **Integers**: Enqueues 10, 20, 30, 40, prints contents, checks size and peek, dequeues one, then dequeues all remaining elements until empty.
    - **Strings**: Enqueues "Hello", "World", "Queue", "Test", prints contents, checks size and peek, and then dequeues two elements.
    - **Characters**: Enqueues 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', prints contents, checks size and peek, and then dequeues all elements, demonstrating a "reversal" effect by outputting them in FIFO order.
