## Array Resizing and Element Access in C++: `Resize` and `GetAt` Methods

This note details the implementation and functionality of `Resize` and `GetAt` methods for arrays in C++, designed for educational purposes to enhance understanding of array operations. The methods are encapsulated within a `class OurArray`.

### **OurArray Class**

The `OurArray` class is designed to contain utility methods for array manipulation, specifically `Resize` and `GetAt`. It includes standard C++ headers like `<iostream>` and `<algorithm>`.

**The code reference:** [[2.2.2-Operations Implementation - Code#Complete Code]]

### **1. The `Resize` Method**

The `Resize` method is used to change the size of an array.

- **Name**: `Resize`
- **Purpose**: To create a new array of a specified size, copy elements from the old array, and reassign the pointer.
- **Assumptions**:
    - Array data is stored in the memory heap.
    - Array address is stored in the memory stack.
- **Inputs**:
    - `sourcePtr`: A reference to the pointer of the array to be resized (type `T*&`).
    - `oldSize`: The current size of the array.
    - `newSize`: The desired new size for the array.
- **Processes/Logic**:
    1. **Validations**:
        - Checks if `newSize` is less than 1.
        - Checks if `sourcePtr` is `nullptr`.
        - Checks if `newSize` is equal to `oldSize`.
        - If any validation fails, the method returns without action.
    2. **Creation of New Array**: If validations pass, a new array (`newArr`) of type `T` and `newSize` is created on the heap, with all elements initialized to their default values.
        - _C++ Implementation_: `T * newArr = new T[newSize]{};`
    3. **Copying Elements**: Elements from the `sourcePtr` array are copied to `newArr`. The `std::copy` function is used, copying up to the minimum of `oldSize` and `newSize` elements. This ensures that only valid elements are copied and prevents issues if the `newSize` is smaller than `oldSize`.
        - _C++ Implementation_: `std::copy(sourcePtr, sourcePtr + std::min(oldSize, newSize), newArr);`
    4. **Deleting Old Array**: The memory occupied by the original array pointed to by `sourcePtr` is deallocated using `delete[]`.
        - _C++ Implementation_: `delete[] sourcePtr;`
    5. **Assigning New Array**: The `sourcePtr` is then updated to point to the newly created and populated array (`newArr`).
        - _C++ Implementation_: `sourcePtr = newArr;`
- **Outputs**: The method returns `nothing` (void). The change is made directly to the array pointed to by `sourcePtr`.

### **2. The `GetAt` Method**

The `GetAt` method is used to retrieve an element from an array at a specific index.

- **Name**: `GetAt`
- **Purpose**: To access and return the value of an element at a specified index within an array.
- **Assumptions**:
    - Array data is stored in the memory heap.
    - Array address is stored in the memory stack.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ArrPtr`: A pointer to the array (type `T*`).
    - `size`: The current size of the array.
    - `idx`: The index of the element to retrieve.
- **Processes/Logic**:
    1. **Validations**:
        - Checks if `idx` is less than 0.
        - Checks if `idx` is greater than or equal to `size`.
        - Checks if `ArrPtr` is `nullptr`.
        - If any validation fails, the method returns a default-constructed value of type `T`. For an integer array, this might result in `0`.
    2. **Get Item**: If validations pass, the value at the `idx` position in the array is retrieved. This involves calculating the memory address of the item and then getting the value from that address.
        - _C++ Implementation_: `result = *(ArrPtr + idx);` where `ArrPtr + idx` calculates the memory address and `*` dereferences it to get the value.
- **Outputs**: A single item of type `T` (the value at the specified index) or a default value if validation fails.

### **Example Usage in `main`**

In the `main` application, an integer array `arr` is initialized with `` and an `OurArray` object `newArr` is created.

1. **Resizing Example**:
    - `newArr.Resize(arr, 3, 5);` is called to resize `arr` from 3 to 5 elements.
    - After resizing, the program iterates and prints the elements of `arr`, which would now be `1 2 3 0 0` (assuming default initialization for new elements is 0).
2. **`GetAt` Example**:
    - `int item = newArr.GetAt(arr, 5, 2);` is called to retrieve the element at index 2 from the resized array.
    - The program then prints `Item = 3`, indicating the successful retrieval of the element at index 2.
