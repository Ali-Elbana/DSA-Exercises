## Arrays

Arrays are a fundamental data structure characterized by their **infrastructure** and **operations**.

### 1. Array Infrastructure

The core infrastructure of an array involves **consecutive memory stores**. This means that the elements of an array are stored contiguously in memory. The compiler is responsible for managing this consecutive memory storage.

### 2. Array Types and Memory Representation

- **Regular Array (1D Array)**:
    
    - Defined in C# using syntax like `Int32[] NumArray = new Int32;`. This example creates an array named `NumArray` capable of holding three 32-bit integers.
    - Individual elements can be assigned values, for example, `NumArray = 1520;` and `NumArray = 1620;`. Values can also be calculated and assigned, such as `NumArray = NumArray + NumArray;`.
    - When an `Int32` variable, like `num = 1520`, is created, its binary representation (e.g., `00000000` to `11101110` across several memory addresses like `0x5040E8` to `0x5040EB`) is stored in memory.
    - Upon initialization of an array like `new Int32`, the memory locations for its elements are allocated and often initialized to zero.
    - **Accessing Data by Index**: Data is accessed using a base address and an offset calculation.
        - The formula for the address of data at a specific index is: `base address + (single value stores count * index)`.
        - For example, if the base address is `0x5040E8` (or `5259496` in decimal), and a single `Int32` value occupies 4 bytes (as implied by the `Int32` type and the memory addresses jumping by 4, e.g., `0x5040E8` to `0x5040EC`), then:
            - Address at index `0`: `5259496 + (4 * 0) = 5259496` (which is `0x5040E8`).
            - Address at index `1`: `5259496 + (4 * 1) = 5259500` (which is `0x5040EC`).
            - Address at index `2`: `5259496 + (4 * 2) = 5259504` (which is `0x5040F0`).

- **2D Array**:
    
    - Visually represented as a grid or a rectangular block.
    - Defined in C# with `Int32[,] NumArray = new Int32;` where the first dimension represents **Rows** and the second represents **Columns**.
    - Memory is allocated contiguously for all elements, mapping rows and columns to linear memory addresses. For example, `0x5040E8` for ``, `0x5040EC` for``, `0x5040F0` for ``, and so on.

- **3D Array**:
    
    - Visually represented as a cube.
    - Defined in C# with `Int32[,,] NumArray = new Int32;`. The dimensions correspond to **Pages**, **Rows**, and **Columns** respectively.
    - Memory is allocated contiguously, with blocks for each "page", and within each page, elements are ordered by row and column.

- **Jagged Array**:
    
    - Represented as `Int32[][] NumArray = new Int32[];` in C#.
    - Unlike multi-dimensional arrays, jagged arrays are arrays of arrays, meaning each inner array can have a different length. For instance, `NumArray` can be `new Int32`, `NumArray` can be `new Int32`, and `NumArray` can be `new Int32`.
    - **Memory Allocation**: The primary array (`NumArray`) is allocated on the **Stack**, storing addresses (pointers) to its inner arrays. The actual inner arrays (`NumArray`, `NumArray`, `NumArray`) are allocated on the **Heap**. The stack stores addresses like `address 0`, `address 1`, `address 2` which point to the respective memory blocks on the heap.

### 3. Array Operations

Operations performed on arrays can be broadly categorized:

- **Static Operations**: These operations generally do not change the size or structure of the array. Our responsibility includes implementing or using operations like:
    
    - `get length`
    - `traverse`
    - `get at` (accessing an element at a specific index)
    - `set at` (modifying an element at a specific index)
- **Dynamic Operations**: These operations typically involve changing the size or re-arranging elements, which can be more complex due to the consecutive memory store requirement of arrays. Examples include:
    
    - `insert at`
    - `delete at`
    - `insert first`
    - `delete first`
    - `insert last`
    - `delete last`

### 4. Array Operations by Programming Language

Different programming languages provide various built-in operations for arrays:

- **C++ Array Operations**:
    
    - Common operations include `begin`, `end`, `rbegin`, `rend`, `cbegin`, `cend`, `crbegin`, `crend` (for iterators).
    - Functions for size and state: `size`, `max_size`, `empty`.
    - Element access: `at`, `front`, `back`, `data`.
    - Manipulation: `fill`, `swap`.
    - Example for filling an array: `std::array<int, 3> numarray; numarray.fill(5);`.
- **PHP Array Operations**:
    
    - A wide range of functions exist, such as `change_key_case`, `chunk`, `column`, `combine`, `count_values`, `diff`, `fill_keys`, `fill`, `filter`, `flip`, `key_exists`, `key_first`, `key_last`, `pop`, `push`, `reverse`, `search`, `shift`, `slice`, `splice`, `sum`.
    - Example for filling an array: `$numArray = array_fill(0, 3, 5);`.
- **JavaScript Array Operations**:
    
    - Includes `concat`, `copyWithin`, `entries`, `every`, `fill`, `filter`, `find`, `findIndex`, `forEach`, `from`, `includes`, `indexOf`, `join`, `keys`, `lastIndexOf`, `length`, `map`, `pop`, `push`, `reduce`, `reverse`, `shift`, `slice`, `some`, `sort`, `splice`, `valueOf`.
    - Example for filling an array: `var numArray = new Array(3); numArray.fill(5);`.
