### C++ Dictionary with Custom Pair Implementation

This note provides an overview of a generic dictionary data structure implemented in C++ using a custom `Pair` class, as detailed in the "C++ Dictionary with Custom Pair Implementation" project documentation. It also draws upon general dictionary concepts from "pdf24_converted.pdf".

**The code reference:** [[6.1.2-KeyValuePair – Dictionary – Code#Complete Code Implementation]]

**1. Key-Value Pair Concept**

- A key-value pair is a fundamental concept where data is stored as a combination of a `Key` and a `Value`. Both the C++ project and the general dictionary concept utilize this structure.
- The C++ implementation features a **custom `Pair` class** that is **template-based**, meaning it can work with any data types for both the key (`K`) and the value (`V`).
- The `Pair` class has **public members**, `first` for the key and `second` for the value, allowing direct access.
- It includes a **full set of constructors** (default, parameterized, and copy constructors) and handles its own **memory management** with a proper assignment operator and destructor. The `main.cpp` demonstrates the `Pair`'s default constructor, parameterized constructor, copy constructor, and assignment operator functionality.

**2. Dictionary Class Overview**

- A dictionary is defined as a **collection of Key-Value pairs** where all keys are of the same type and all values are of the same type.
- The implemented C++ `Dictionary` class is also **template-based**, providing a generic design for any key-value types.
- It uses a `vector<Pair<K, V>>` as its **underlying data structure** for storing key-value pairs. This differs from the conceptual `Dictionary` in `pdf24_converted.pdf` which uses an `entries: KeyValuePair[]` (an array) as its infrastructure.
- The C++ `Dictionary` class includes a private `data` member (the vector) and public methods for its operations. It contains the `Pair` class.

**3. Core Methods and Operations** The C++ `Dictionary` provides several core methods:

- `get(key)`: Returns the value for a given key. It searches for the key in the `data` vector and returns the corresponding value if found. If the key is not found, it throws a `runtime_error`.

- `set(key, value)`: Adds or updates a key-value pair. If the key already exists, its value is updated; otherwise, a new pair is added to the `vector`. The conceptual `Set` operation in `pdf24_converted.pdf` involves searching for the key, updating if it exists, or creating a new `KeyValuePair` and adding it if it doesn't, potentially calling a `ResizeOrNot()` function.

- `remove(key)`: Removes a key-value pair. It searches for the key and erases the corresponding pair from the `vector`, returning `true` on success and `false` if the key is not found. The conceptual `Remove` operation in `pdf24_converted.pdf` involves replacing the found entry with the last entry, setting the last entry to null, and decreasing the `entriesCount`.

- `size()`: Returns the number of pairs in the dictionary. This is an O(1) operation.
- `print()`: Displays all key-value pairs in the dictionary.
- `clear()`: Removes all pairs from the dictionary. This is an O(1) operation.

---
**4. Performance Characteristics**

- **Simple Implementation:** The project aims for simplicity, making it easy to understand and modify.
- **Time Complexity:** Most core operations like `get`, `set` (update), and `remove` have an **O(n) average and worst-case time complexity** due to the **linear search** method used.
    - `get`: O(1) best case (first element), O(n/2) average case, O(n) worst case (last element or not found).
    - `set` (new item): O(1) best, average, and worst case, as new items are `push_back`ed after checking existing keys.
    - `set` (update existing): O(1) best case, O(n/2) average case, O(n) worst case.
    - `remove`: O(1) best case, O(n/2) average case, O(n) worst case.
    - `size()` and `clear()` are O(1) operations.
- **Disadvantages:** This implementation suffers from **poor performance** for most operations and is **not suitable for large datasets** because performance degrades significantly with increasing size. There is **no inherent ordering** of items; they are stored in insertion order only.

---
**5. Memory Management and Exception Handling**

- **Memory Management:** The custom `Pair` class handles its own memory, and the underlying `vector` automatically manages dynamic allocation. Proper copy constructors and assignment operators are implemented to prevent memory leaks.
- **Exception Handling:** The dictionary throws a `runtime_error` for operations like `get` when a key is not found. Usage examples demonstrate how to catch these exceptions.

---
**6. Usage Examples** The dictionary supports various type combinations, such as `Dictionary<string, int>`, `Dictionary<int, string>`, and `Dictionary<string, string>`. Basic operations like adding, getting, checking existence, and removing items are demonstrated.

---
**7. Alternative Improvements** To enhance the dictionary, the following improvements are suggested:

- **For Better Performance:**
    - Using a **Hash Table** for O(1) average-case operations.
    - Employing a **Binary Search Tree** for O(log n) operations, which also maintains sorted order.
    - Storing data in a **Sorted Vector** and using binary search for O(log n) lookup.
- **For More Features:**
    - Adding **Iterators** (`begin`/`end` methods) for range-based loops.
    - **Overloading the `[]` operator** for easier element access.
    - Implementing **const correctness** with more const methods and parameters.
