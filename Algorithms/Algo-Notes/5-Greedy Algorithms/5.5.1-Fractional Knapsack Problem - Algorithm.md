### Fractional Knapsack Problem

The **Fractional Knapsack Problem** is a classic optimization problem that employs a **Greedy Algorithm** to find the most profitable way to fill a knapsack of a given capacity. The objective is to maximize the total profit of items selected, given that items can be broken into fractions.

#### Problem Description

Imagine you have a knapsack with a specific weight capacity and a collection of items, each with an associated profit and weight. Unlike the 0/1 Knapsack Problem, in the Fractional Knapsack Problem, you **can take fractions of items**. The goal is to select items (or parts of items) to put into the knapsack such that the **total profit is maximized without exceeding the knapsack's weight capacity**.

#### Algorithm Steps (Greedy Approach)

The solution to the Fractional Knapsack Problem follows these key steps:

1.  **Calculate Ratios**: For each item, compute its **profit-to-weight ratio** (profit / weight). This ratio represents the profit gained per unit of weight for that item.
    *   In the C++ implementation, this is done for each `Item` object by setting `item.ratio = item.profit / item.weight`.
2.  **Sort Items**: **Sort all items in decreasing order based on their calculated profit-to-weight ratio**. Items with a higher ratio are considered more valuable per unit of weight.
    *   The `compare` function `return a.ratio > b.ratio;` is used for this sorting.
3.  **Fill Knapsack**: Iterate through the sorted items and add them to the knapsack:
    *   If the current item's **entire weight can fit** within the `remainingCapacity` of the knapsack, add the whole item.
    *   If the current item's weight is **greater than the `remainingCapacity`**, add only a **fraction** of the item. The fraction is calculated as `remainingCapacity / item.weight`. Once a fraction of an item is taken, the knapsack capacity will be fully utilized.
    *   Update the `totalProfit` and `remainingCapacity` after adding each item or fraction.
    *   The process stops when the `remainingCapacity` is less than or equal to zero.

#### C++ Implementation Details

The provided C++ [[5.5.2-Fractional Knapsack Problem - Code#âœ… The overall code]] code demonstrates this algorithm:

*   **`Item` Struct**: Defines an item with `index`, `profit`, `weight`, and `ratio`. The `index` helps identify the original item number.
*   **`getItemsFromUser` Function**: Handles user input to populate a `vector<Item>` with profit and weight for each item, initially setting `ratio` to 0.
*   **`fractionalKnapsack` Function**:
    *   Takes a `vector<Item>` and `capacity` as input.
    *   Calculates ratios for all items.
    *   Uses `std::sort` with the `compare` function to sort items.
    *   Iterates through sorted items, determining the `fraction` to take and updating `totalProfit` and `remainingCapacity`.
    *   Stores selected items and their taken fractions in a `vector<pair<Item, double>>` named `storedItems`.
    *   Outputs the `Maximum profit` and details of `Selected items` including their original index, profit, weight, and the percentage taken, formatted for clarity.

#### Example Illustration

Consider an example with a knapsack capacity of **12 Kg**. The items have profits and weights as follows:

| Item    | #0 | #1 | #2 | #3 | #4 | #5 |
| :------ | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Profit($) | 4  | 9  | 12 | 11 | 6  | 5  |
| Weight(Kg)| 1  | 2  | 10 | 4  | 3  | 5  |

Following the greedy algorithm:
1.  **Calculate Ratios**:
    *   Item #0: 4/1 = 4
    *   Item #1: 9/2 = 4.5
    *   Item #2: 12/10 = 1.2
    *   Item #3: 11/4 = 2.75
    *   Item #4: 6/3 = 2
    *   Item #5: 5/5 = 1
2.  **Sort by Ratio (decreasing)**: Item #1 (4.5), Item #0 (4), Item #3 (2.75), Item #4 (2), Item #2 (1.2), Item #5 (1)
3.  **Fill Knapsack (capacity 12 Kg)**:
    *   Take Item #1 (Profit $9, Weight 2kg). Remaining Capacity: 10kg. Total Profit: $9.
    *   Take Item #0 (Profit $4, Weight 1kg). Remaining Capacity: 9kg. Total Profit: $9 + $4 = $13.
    *   Take Item #3 (Profit $11, Weight 4kg). Remaining Capacity: 5kg. Total Profit: $13 + $11 = $24.
    *   Take Item #4 (Profit $6, Weight 3kg). Remaining Capacity: 2kg. Total Profit: $24 + $6 = $30.
    *   Item #2 (Weight 10kg) is too large for 2kg remaining capacity. Take a fraction: 2kg / 10kg = 0.2 of Item #2. Profit from fraction: 0.2 * $12 = $2.4. Remaining Capacity: 0kg. Total Profit: $30 + $2.4 = **$32.4**.

The final selected items and their contribution to profit and weight are shown as:
| Item      | #1 | #0 | #3 | #4 | #2 (fraction) | total |
| :-------- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :------------ | :---- |
| Profit($) | 9  | 4  | 11 | 6  | 2.4           | 32.4  |
| Weight(Kg)| 2  | 1  | 4  | 3  | 2             | 12    |

#### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the Fractional Knapsack Problem, when implemented with sorting, is **O(n log n)**. This is primarily dominated by the sorting step (merge sort), where 'n' is the number of items.

The Fractional Knapsack Problem is like **filling a shopping cart for a special sale where everything is priced per pound**. You want to get the most valuable items, but you're limited by the total weight your cart can hold. Instead of just grabbing whole items, you can buy exactly the amount you need (e.g., half a bag of flour, 0.75 lbs. of coffee beans) to ensure you fill your cart to the brim with the most "bang for your buck" items first, maximizing your overall savings.
