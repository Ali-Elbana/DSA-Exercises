### Introduction

The **Stagecoach Problem** is a classic optimization problem that seeks to find the **minimum cost path** through a series of stages from a starting point to a final destination. It is elegantly solved using **Dynamic Programming**. The problem is conceptualized with a stagecoach traveling between various locations, incurring a certain "cost" for each leg of the journey.

### Problem Representation

The problem is modeled as a **multi-stage graph**:

- **Nodes (Labels):** Represent different locations or stages. In the given example, there are 10 nodes labeled A through J.
- **Edges (Routes):** Represent the possible paths between locations.
- **Costs:** Each edge has an associated numerical value, representing the cost of traveling that route.
- **Adjacency Matrix:** The graph structure and associated costs are often represented using an **adjacency matrix** (e.g., a `vector<vector<int>>` named `graph` in C++). A value of `0` in `graph[i][j]` indicates no direct path between node `i` and node `j`.

### Dynamic Programming Approach

Dynamic Programming solves the Stagecoach Problem by breaking it down into smaller, overlapping subproblems. The core idea is to find the optimal solution for these subproblems and use those solutions to build up the optimal solution for the overall problem.

There are two primary methods for calculation in this context:

1. **Backward Calculation (Used in C++ code [[6.1.2-Stagecoach - Code#Overall Code]]):**
    
    - This method starts from the **final destination node** (J in this case) and works backward, stage by stage, towards the initial starting node (A).
    - For each node `i`, the algorithm calculates the **minimum total cost from node `i` to the final destination**.
    - The recursive relationship for this method is: `cost(current_node) = min(cost(current_node, next_node) + cost(next_node, destination))`. This means the minimum cost from the current node is found by considering all possible next steps, adding the direct cost of that step to the already calculated minimum cost from that `next_node` to the destination.
    - An auxiliary data structure, `vStates`, is used to store the calculated minimum cost (`cost`) for each node and the next node (`to`) that leads to this minimum cost.
    - **Initialization:** The cost from the destination node to itself is `0`. All other nodes are initialized with a very large cost (e.g., `INT_MAX`).
2. **Forward Calculation (Illustrated in the PDF):**
    
    - This method starts from the **initial source node** (A) and works forward, stage by stage, towards the final destination node (J).
    - For each node, it calculates the **minimum total cost from the source to that node**.
    - While not explicitly implemented in the provided C++ code, this is an equally valid dynamic programming approach that yields the same overall minimum cost.

### Algorithm Steps (Backward Calculation, as per C++ Code)

The C++ code provided implements the backward calculation approach:

1. **Data Structures Initialization:**
    
    - A `vector<States> vStates` is created, where `States` is a struct holding `from` (current node label), `to` (optimal next node label), and `cost` (minimum cost from `from` to the destination).
    - The last node (J, `vStates[n-1]`) has its `cost` initialized to `0`.
    - All other nodes (`vStates[i]` for `i < n-1`) are initialized with their label, an empty `to` string, and `INT_MAX` for their cost.
2. **Iterative Backward Calculation:**
    
    - The algorithm iterates backward through the nodes, from the second-to-last node (`n-2`) down to the first node (`0`) (represented by variable `i`).
    - For each node `i`, it then iterates through all potential subsequent nodes `j` (where `j` is greater than `i`).
    - **Cost Calculation:** If a direct path exists from `i` to `j` (i.e., `graph[i][j]` is not `0`), a `new_cost` is calculated: `new_cost = graph[i][j] + vStates[j].cost`. This sums the direct cost from `i` to `j` with the already determined minimum cost from `j` to the destination.
    - **Optimal Path Update:** If `new_cost` is less than the `vStates[i].cost` currently stored for node `i`, `vStates[i].cost` is updated to `new_cost`, and `vStates[i].to` is set to `labels[j]` (the node that yields this minimum cost). This ensures that `vStates[i]` always stores the path with the lowest cumulative cost from `i` to the destination.
3. **Shortest Path Reconstruction:**
    
    - After the backward iteration completes, `vStates.cost` will hold the minimum cost from the starting node A to the destination J.
    - The actual path is then reconstructed by starting from node A and repeatedly following the `vStates[current_node_index].to` value until the destination is reached.

### Example from Sources and Noted Discrepancy

The sources provide a concrete example with 10 nodes (A-J) and specific costs between them.

- The **minimum cost** calculated by both the C++ code output and the PDF illustrations for the entire journey from A to J is **11**.

Regarding the actual path, there is a minor discrepancy between the two sources:

- The **C++ code output** states the minimum path is: **A --> B --> E --> H --> J**.
- However, a manual trace of the C++ code's logic (which prioritizes updates only when `new_cost` is _strictly less_ than the current best cost, and iterates through `j` in increasing order) with the provided `graph` data would lead to the path **A --> C --> E --> H --> J**. This latter path is also visually depicted and derived in the "Backward Calculation" section of the PDF.

This discrepancy highlights that for this particular problem instance, **multiple optimal paths exist** that achieve the same minimum cost of 11. The specific path reported depends on how ties in cost are resolved by the algorithm's implementation details.
