### **Introduction**

Binary search is a highly efficient algorithm for finding an element's position in a **sorted** array or list. It operates by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, making it significantly faster than linear search for large datasets. Binary search has a time complexity of **O(log n)**, making it ideal for scenarios where performance is crucial.

### **Steps of Binary Search**

1. **Initialization**: Define the search range using two pointers, `low` and `high`, which represent the bounds of the array.
2. **Midpoint Calculation**: Find the middle element using: mid=low+high−low2\text{mid} = \text{low} + \frac{\text{high} - \text{low}}{2}
3. **Comparison**:
    - If the target value matches the middle element, return the index.
    - If the target value is smaller, adjust the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`.
    - If the target value is larger, adjust the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`.
4. **Repeat**: Continue the process until the target value is found or the `low` pointer exceeds the `high` pointer.

### **C++ Implementation**

#### **Iterative Binary Search**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int binarySearch(const vector<int>& arr, int target) {
    int low = 0, high = arr.size() - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2; // Prevents overflow
        if (arr[mid] == target)
            return mid;
        else if (arr[mid] < target)
            low = mid + 1;
        else
            high = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1; // Target not found
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14};
    int target = 10;
    int result = binarySearch(arr, target);

    if (result != -1)
        cout << "Element found at index " << result << endl;
    else
        cout << "Element not found" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Recursive Binary Search**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int binarySearchRecursive(const vector<int>& arr, int low, int high, int target) {
    if (low > high)
        return -1; // Target not found

    int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

    if (arr[mid] == target)
        return mid;
    else if (arr[mid] < target)
        return binarySearchRecursive(arr, mid + 1, high, target);
    else
        return binarySearchRecursive(arr, low, mid - 1, target);
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14};
    int target = 6;
    int result = binarySearchRecursive(arr, 0, arr.size() - 1, target);

    if (result != -1)
        cout << "Element found at index " << result << endl;
    else
        cout << "Element not found" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### **Algorithm Complexity**

#### **Time Complexity**

- **Best Case**:  
    The target element is found at the midpoint on the first check.  
    **Time Complexity**: O(1)O(1)
    
- **Worst Case**:  
    In the worst-case scenario, the algorithm keeps halving the array until the target is found or the array cannot be divided further.  
    For an array of size n, the maximum number of iterations is:
    **⌈log⁡2(n)⌉**
    
    **Time Complexity**: O(log⁡ n)
    
- **Average Case**:  
    On average, the binary search algorithm requires O(log ⁡n) comparisons.

### **Space Complexity**

1. **Iterative Binary Search**:
    
    - The algorithm only uses a constant amount of space to store the `low`, `high`, and `mid` pointers.  
        **Space Complexity**: O(1)
2. **Recursive Binary Search**:
    
    - Each recursive call adds a frame to the call stack. For a sorted array of size n, the maximum depth of recursion is **⌈log⁡2(n)⌉**.  
        **Space Complexity**: O(log ⁡n)

### **Comparison of Iterative vs Recursive Approach**

|**Approach**|**Time Complexity**|**Space Complexity**|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Iterative|O(log⁡n)O(\log n)|O(1)O(1)|Memory efficient|Slightly more complex logic|
|Recursive|O(log⁡n)O(\log n)|O(log⁡n)O(\log n)|Simpler implementation|Memory overhead for recursion|

### **Use Cases**

1. **Searching in Sorted Arrays**: Efficiently locating elements in pre-sorted data structures.
2. **Databases**: Quickly retrieving records from sorted datasets.
3. **Games**: Optimizing AI decisions or locating specific items in sorted inventories.
4. **Libraries**: Searching for books in cataloged systems based on title or index.
5. **Networking**: Finding the closest match in sorted routing tables.

### **Real-Life Applications**

1. **Phone Directory**: Locating a contact by name in an alphabetically sorted phone book.
2. **Spell Checkers**: Searching for a word in a sorted dictionary to suggest corrections.
3. **E-commerce**: Filtering and searching products based on sorted price or rating.
4. **Medical Diagnosis**: Rapid matching of patient symptoms against a sorted database of conditions.
5. **Astronomy**: Finding celestial objects in sorted star catalogs based on brightness or position.

### **Key Advantages**

- Extremely efficient for large datasets.
- Reduces time complexity to logarithmic growth.

### **Limitations**

- Requires the array to be **sorted**.
- Inefficient for dynamic datasets where frequent insertions or deletions occur.

### **Practice Question**

Write a function to search for a target in a sorted, rotated array (e.g., `[10, 12, 14, 2, 4, 6, 8]`). Use binary search logic to achieve **O(log n)** complexity.
