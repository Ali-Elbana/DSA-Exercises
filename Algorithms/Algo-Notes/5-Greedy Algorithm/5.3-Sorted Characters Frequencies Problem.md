### **Problem Description**

Given a string, rearrange its characters in decreasing order of their frequencies. If two characters have the same frequency, their relative order does not matter.

#### **Objective**

Rearrange the string such that characters with higher frequencies appear first.

---
### **Greedy Strategy**

The problem can be solved using a greedy approach:

1. **Count the frequency** of each character in the string.
2. **Sort** characters by frequency in descending order.
3. Construct the result string by appending each character based on its frequency.

---
### **Pseudocode**

```plaintext
SortCharactersByFrequency(string s):
    1. Create a frequency map for all characters in the string.
    2. Store characters and their frequencies in a list.
    3. Sort the list in descending order of frequency.
    4. Construct the result string by repeating each character based on its frequency.
    5. Return the result string.
```

### **C++ Implementation**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

string sortCharactersByFrequency(const string& s) {
    // Step 1: Count frequencies of characters
    unordered_map<char, int> freqMap;
    for (char c : s) {
        freqMap[c]++;
    }

    // Step 2: Store characters and their frequencies in a vector
    vector<pair<char, int>> freqVec(freqMap.begin(), freqMap.end());

    // Step 3: Sort the vector by frequency in descending order
    sort(freqVec.begin(), freqVec.end(), [](const pair<char, int>& a, const pair<char, int>& b) {
        return a.second > b.second; // Sort by frequency
    });

    // Step 4: Construct the result string
    string result;
    for (const auto& pair : freqVec) {
        result += string(pair.second, pair.first); // Repeat character by its frequency
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    string input = "tree";
    cout << "Input String: " << input << endl;
    string sortedString = sortCharactersByFrequency(input);
    cout << "Sorted by Frequency: " << sortedString << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### **Example Input and Output**

#### **Input**:

```plaintext
tree
```

#### **Output**:

```plaintext
eert
```

Explanation:

- The frequency of 'e' is 2, so it appears first.
- The frequency of 'r' and 't' is 1 each, and their order is arbitrary.

---
### **Pros of Greedy Strategy**

1. **Efficiency**:
    - Sorting by frequency is O(n log⁡ n), where n is the number of unique characters.
2. **Simplicity**:
    - The algorithm is easy to implement and understand.

---
### **Cons of Greedy Strategy**

1. **Not Optimal for Custom Constraints**:
    - If additional constraints (e.g., adjacent characters must be different) are introduced, the greedy strategy may fail.
2. **Space Complexity**:
    - Requires additional space for frequency mapping and storage.

---
### **Conclusion**

The **Sorted Characters by Frequency** problem is a simple example of using the greedy approach to solve optimization problems efficiently. This algorithm is suitable for scenarios where sorting by some criterion (like frequency) is required, but it may need modifications for more complex constraints.
