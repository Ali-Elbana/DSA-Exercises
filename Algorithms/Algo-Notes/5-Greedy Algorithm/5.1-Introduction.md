### **Definition**:

A **greedy algorithm** is a problem-solving approach that builds a solution step by step, always choosing the option that seems the most advantageous at each step. The key principle of the greedy method is to make a locally optimal choice with the hope that this leads to a globally optimal solution.

---
### **Core Idea**

The greedy algorithm works by:

1. Dividing the problem into smaller subproblems.
2. Solving each subproblem by selecting the best possible option available at that moment.
3. Combining the solutions of subproblems to form the final result.

#### **Key Characteristics**

- **Greedy Choice Property**: A global solution can be arrived at by choosing locally optimal solutions.
- **Optimal Substructure**: A problem exhibits this property if an optimal solution to the entire problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems.

### **Advantages**

1. **Efficiency**: Greedy algorithms are often faster and simpler than other methods like dynamic programming.
2. **Intuitive**: The step-by-step approach is easy to understand and implement.

---
### **Limitations**

- Greedy algorithms may not always produce the optimal solution for all problems.
- They work best when the problem guarantees the greedy choice property and optimal substructure.

---
### **Use Cases**

Greedy algorithms are widely used in scenarios where an optimal or near-optimal solution is required efficiently:

1. **Graph Problems**: Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's, Kruskal's), Shortest Path (Dijkstra's).
2. **Optimization Problems**: Activity selection, job scheduling.
3. **Resource Allocation**: Huffman encoding for data compression.

Greedy algorithms are a powerful tool for solving many real-world problems efficiently. However, their effectiveness depends on the problem's structure, so understanding the problem constraints is crucial before applying this approach.
