### **Problem Description**

The **Activity Selection Problem** involves scheduling the maximum number of activities that do not overlap. Each activity is defined by:

- **Start Time (s)**: When the activity begins.
- **Finish Time (f)**: When the activity ends.

#### **Objective**

Select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities from a given list of activities.

### **Greedy Strategy**

To solve this problem using a greedy approach:

1. **Sort** the activities by their **finish times**.
2. Iteratively select the activity that starts after or when the last selected activity ends.

---
### **Pseudocode**

```plaintext
ActivitySelection(activities):
    1. Sort activities by their finish times.
    2. Select the first activity and initialize the end time.
    3. For each subsequent activity:
        a. If the start time of the activity is >= the end time of the last selected activity:
            i. Select the activity.
            ii. Update the end time.
    4. Return the list of selected activities.
```

### **C++ Implementation**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

struct Activity {
    int start, finish;

    // Sort activities by finish time
    bool operator<(const Activity& other) const {
        return finish < other.finish;
    }
};

vector<Activity> activitySelection(const vector<Activity>& activities) {
    vector<Activity> selected;

    // Sort activities by their finish times
    vector<Activity> sortedActivities = activities;
    sort(sortedActivities.begin(), sortedActivities.end());

    // Select the first activity
    selected.push_back(sortedActivities[0]);
    int lastFinishTime = sortedActivities[0].finish;

    // Iterate through remaining activities
    for (size_t i = 1; i < sortedActivities.size(); i++) {
        if (sortedActivities[i].start >= lastFinishTime) {
            selected.push_back(sortedActivities[i]);
            lastFinishTime = sortedActivities[i].finish;
        }
    }

    return selected;
}

int main() {
    vector<Activity> activities = {{1, 4}, {3, 5}, {0, 6}, {5, 7}, {8, 9}, {5, 9}};
    
    vector<Activity> result = activitySelection(activities);

    cout << "Selected activities:" << endl;
    for (const auto& activity : result) {
        cout << "(" << activity.start << ", " << activity.finish << ")" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **Example Input and Output**

#### **Input**:

Activities = [(1, 4), (3, 5), (0, 6), (5, 7), (8, 9), (5, 9)]

#### **Output**:

Selected Activities = [(1, 4), (5, 7), (8, 9)]

---
### **Steps**

1. **Sort by Finish Time**:  
    After sorting:  
    [(1, 4), (3, 5), (0, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9), (8, 9)]
    
2. **Select Activities**:
    
    - Select (1, 4).
    - Skip (3, 5) and (0, 6) as they overlap with (1, 4).
    - Select (5, 7).
    - Skip (5, 9) as it overlaps with (5, 7).
    - Select (8, 9).

---
### **Pros of Greedy Strategy**

1. **Efficiency**:
    
    - Time complexity: O(n log ⁡n) (due to sorting).
    - Space complexity: O(1) (constant additional space).
2. **Simplicity**:
    
    - The algorithm is straight-forward to implement and understand.

---
### **Cons of Greedy Strategy**

1. **Constraints Dependent**:
    
    - Greedy algorithms can fail if the problem requires a global perspective or additional constraints.
2. **Not Always Optimal**:
    
    - While it works well for the activity selection problem, greedy strategies are not universally applicable.

---
### **Conclusion**

The **Activity Selection Problem** illustrates the power of greedy algorithms in solving optimization problems with clear constraints. By sorting activities by their finish times and selecting non-overlapping ones, the algorithm efficiently finds the optimal solution.
