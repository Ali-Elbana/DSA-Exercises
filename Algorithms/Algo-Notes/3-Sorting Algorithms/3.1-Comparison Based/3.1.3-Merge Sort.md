### **Definition**:

Merge sort is a **divide-and-conquer** sorting algorithm that splits an array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together. It is a stable and efficient sorting method for large datasets.

---
### **How It Works**:

1. **Divide**: The array is divided into two halves until each subarray contains a single element (base case).
2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort each subarray.
3. **Combine**: Merge the sorted subarrays back into a single sorted array.

---
### **Algorithm Steps**:

1. Find the middle index of the array.
2. Divide the array into two halves: left and right.
3. Recursively apply merge sort to both halves.
4. Merge the two sorted halves using a helper function.

### **Pseudocode**:

```text
function merge_sort(array):
    if size of array <= 1:
        return array
    
    mid = length(array) / 2
    left_half = array[0:mid]
    right_half = array[mid:end]
    
    merge_sort(left_half)
    merge_sort(right_half)
    
    return merge(left_half, right_half)
```

---
### **How Merge Done**:

- Compare the elements pointed to by the index.
    - Place the smaller element into the target array.
    - Move the index for the subarray from which the element was taken.
- Repeat the comparison and placement until one of the subarrays is exhausted.
- Copy the remaining elements of the non-empty subarray into the target array.

### **Implementation in C++**:

Here’s a simple implementation of the merge sort algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Function to merge two sorted subarrays
void merge(vector<int>& arr, int start, int mid, int end) {
    vector<int> left(arr.begin() + start, arr.begin() + mid + 1);
    vector<int> right(arr.begin() + mid + 1, arr.begin() + end + 1);

    int i = 0, j = 0, k = start;
    while (i < left.size() && j < right.size()) {
        if (left[i] <= right[j]) {
            arr[k++] = left[i++];
        } else {
            arr[k++] = right[j++];
        }
    }

    while (i < left.size()) {
        arr[k++] = left[i++];
    }

    while (j < right.size()) {
        arr[k++] = right[j++];
    }
}

// Recursive merge sort function
void merge_sort(vector<int>& arr, int start, int end) {
    if (start >= end) return;

    int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
    merge_sort(arr, start, mid);
    merge_sort(arr, mid + 1, end);
    merge(arr, start, mid, end);
}

// Main function to demonstrate merge sort
int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {9, 5, 1, 4, 6, 7, 3, 8, 2};

    cout << "Unsorted array: ";
    for (int num : arr) cout << num << " ";
    cout << endl;

    merge_sort(arr, 0, arr.size() - 1);

    cout << "Sorted array: ";
    for (int num : arr) cout << num << " ";
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### **Analysis**:

#### **Introduction to the Recursion-Tree Method**

The **recursion-tree method** is a visual tool used to analyze the time complexity of recursive algorithms. It represents the recursive calls as a tree, where each node corresponds to a function call, and the branches represent the subsequent recursive calls. The total work of the algorithm is obtained by summing the work at each level of the tree.

#### **Using Merge Sort as an Example**

##### **Merge Sort Algorithm Recap**:

- **Divide**: Split the array into two halves.
- **Conquer**: Recursively sort each half.
- **Combine**: Merge the two sorted halves into one sorted array.

##### **Constructing the Recursion Tree**

1. **Root Node**:
    
    - At the top level, the size of the array is n, and the merging step takes O(n) time.
    - Total work: O(n).
2. **Level 1**:
    
    - The array is divided into two halves, each of size n/2.
    - Two recursive calls are made, and the merging step for each call takes O(n/2) time.
    - Total work at this level: 2 * O(n/2) = O(n).
3. **Level 2**:
    
    - Each half is further divided into two subarrays of size n/4.
    - Four recursive calls are made, and the merging step for each call takes O(n/4) time.
    - Total work at this level: 4 * O(n/4) = O(n).
4. **Repeat Until Base Case**:
    
    - The recursion continues until each subarray is of size 1.
    - At the base level, there are n subarrays, each requiring O(1) time.

#### **Summing the Work**

Each level of the recursion tree performs O(n) work. The height of the tree is log⁡2(n) (because the array is halved at each level).

Thus, the total work is:

- F(n) = O(n) * log2​(n) = O(n log n)

#### **Benefits of the Recursion-Tree Method**

- **Visual Representation**: Helps to clearly see how work is distributed across recursive calls.
- **Intuition**: Provides insight into how the input size decreases and the merging process contributes to the total time complexity.
- **Validation**: Confirms the O(n log ⁡n) complexity for merge sort.

#### **Summary**:
##### **Time Complexity**:
- **Best Case**: O(n log ⁡n)
- **Average Case**: O(n log ⁡n)
- **Worst Case**: O(n log⁡ n)

#### **Space Complexity**:
- O(n): Additional memory is required for temporary arrays during merging.

### **Use Cases**:

1. **Large Datasets**: Merge sort is efficient for large datasets where other algorithms like bubble or insertion sort are inefficient.
2. **Linked Lists**: It works well with linked lists because of their sequential nature and easy division.
3. **Stable Sorting**: Since merge sort maintains the relative order of equal elements, it's used when stability is required.

---
### **Life Applications**:

1. **File Sorting**:
    - When dealing with large files that don’t fit in memory, merge sort can sort chunks of the file and then merge them.
2. **Image Processing**:
    - Sorting pixel intensity values for operations like histogram generation or filtering.
3. **Data Merging**:
    - Combining multiple sorted datasets into one (e.g., merging logs from distributed servers in chronological order).
4. **Shape Drawing**:
    - When rendering 3D graphics, merge sort can organize objects by depth to determine rendering order.
