# Introduction to Graph in Programming

Graphs are fundamental data structures used in computer science to model relationships between entities. They consist of two main components: vertices and edges.

## Graph Lingo (Key Terminology)

- **Vertices**: These are the fundamental units of a graph. They can also be referred to as **Nodes** or **Points**. In the provided sources, these are typically represented as circles containing numbers or letters.
- **Edges**: These represent the connections or relationships between vertices. Edges can also be called **Links** or **Lines**. They are depicted as lines connecting the vertices.

## Types of Graphs

The sources illustrate several types of graphs and related structures:

- **Binary Tree**: A hierarchical data structure which is a specific type of graph where each node has at most two children.
- **Heap**: Another specific tree-based data structure, also a type of graph, often used for priority queues.
- **Null Graph**: A graph that contains vertices but has no edges connecting them.
- **Directed Graph**: In this type of graph, edges have a specific direction, indicated by arrows. This means a connection from one vertex to another does not necessarily imply a connection in the reverse direction.
- **Undirected Graph**: Edges in an undirected graph do not have a specific direction. A connection between two vertices implies a bidirectional relationship.
- **Connected Graph**: A graph where there is a path between every pair of vertices, meaning all parts of the graph are reachable from each other.
- **Disconnected Graph**: A graph where at least one pair of vertices has no path connecting them, resulting in separate components.
- **Complete Graph**: A graph in which every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex by an edge.
- **Pseudo Graph**: A graph that allows for "loops" (an edge connecting a vertex to itself) and/or multiple edges between the same two vertices.

## Applications of Graphs

Graphs are widely used to model various real-world scenarios:

- **Maps**: Roads can be represented as edges, and the points connected by these roads (e.g., intersections, cities) are the vertices.
- **Social Networks**: The relationships between friends, or interactions like "likes" and "shares," can be modeled as edges, while individuals or content are vertices.
- **Operating Systems**: Processes and the resources allocated to them can be represented as vertices, with the allocation itself forming an edge from a process to a resource.
- **Networks**: This includes various network types such as computer networks (e.g., internet, local networks) and electricity networks, where connections are edges and devices/locations are vertices.

## Graph Representation

In programming, graphs can be represented in different ways. The sources highlight two common methods:

### Adjacency Matrix

An **Adjacency Matrix** represents a graph as a square matrix where rows represent "From" vertices and columns represent "To" vertices.

- For a **weighted graph**, the value in `matrix[i][j]` would indicate the weight of the edge from vertex `i` to vertex `j`. A zero (0) typically means no direct connection.
- For an **unweighted graph**, a '1' in `matrix[i][j]` signifies the presence of an edge from vertex `i` to vertex `j`, while a '0' signifies no direct edge.
- The matrix size is `V x V`, where V is the number of vertices.

For example, in a graph where 'A' connects to 'B' with a weight of 2, the entry in row 'A', column 'B' of the adjacency matrix would be '2'.

### Adjacency List

An **Adjacency List** represents a graph as an array or a list where each index `i` corresponds to a vertex `i`. At each index `i`, there is a list of all vertices adjacent to vertex `i`. This list is often implemented using a data structure like a **Linked List**.

- This representation is particularly efficient for **sparse graphs** (graphs with relatively few edges).
- Each entry in the list for a given "From" vertex represents a "To" vertex that it connects to.
- A **Linked List** is a sequence of data items (nodes) where each item points to the next, like `item1` pointing to `item2`, and `item2` pointing to `item3`, and so on, with the last item pointing to null. This sequential linking is used to store the neighbors of each vertex in an adjacency list.

For example, for vertex 'A', its adjacency list might contain 'B', 'C', and 'D', indicating that A has outgoing edges to B, C, and D.
