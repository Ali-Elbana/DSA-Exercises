## Introduction

Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm is designed to find the **shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph**. It is commonly used in applications such as navigation systems to determine the quickest routes, as depicted by a map showing routes between Tampa and Orlando with calculated travel times and distances.

### Core Components and C++ Implementation

The provided C++ implementation [[7.5.2-Dijkstra’s Shortest Path – Code#Complete Code Implementation]] of Dijkstra's algorithm utilizes several classes to represent the graph structure:

- **`Vertex` Class**: Represents a node in the graph.
    
    - `name`: A string identifier for the vertex (e.g., "A", "B", "C").
    - `edges`: A vector of `Edge` objects connected to this vertex.
    - `isVisited`: A boolean flag, though it's set to `false` in the `reset` function and `Vertex` constructor, it's not explicitly used in the provided `Dijkstra` method.
    - `totalDist`: A `double` value representing the **current shortest distance found from the starting vertex to this vertex**. It is initialized to `numeric_limits<double>::infinity()` for all vertices, except the starting vertex which is set to `0`.
    - `prev`: A pointer to the `Vertex` that comes just before this vertex on the shortest path found so far. It is initialized to `nullptr`.
- **`Edge` Class**: Represents a connection between two vertices.
    
    - `target`: A pointer to the `Vertex` that this edge points to.
    - `weight`: A `double` value representing the **cost or distance of traversing this edge**.
- **`Graph` Class**: Manages the collection of vertices and provides methods for graph operations.
    
    - **Constructor**: Takes a vector of `string` names to create and store `Vertex` objects in its `vertices` vector.
    - **`addEdges(int from, const vector<int> & to, const vector<double> & weights)`**: A method to **add directed edges** from a `Vertex` specified by its index (`from`) to multiple `target` vertices (specified by `to` indices) with corresponding `weights`. For example, `g.addEdges(0, {1, 2, 3}, {2, 4, 3})` adds edges from vertex at index 0 (which is "A") to vertices at indices 1 ("B"), 2 ("C"), and 3 ("D") with weights 2, 4, and 3 respectively.
    - **`Dijkstra(void)`**: This is the method intended to compute the shortest paths.
        - It **initializes the `totalDist` of the first vertex (`vertices`) to 0**. This vertex acts as the source for shortest path calculation.
        - It then iterates through **all vertices** in the `vertices` vector.
        - For each `vertex` (`v`), it iterates through all of its **outgoing `edges`**.
        - It calculates a `newDist` by adding the current vertex's `totalDist` to the `edge.weight`.
        - If this `newDist` is less than the `edge.target->totalDist`, it **updates the `edge.target->totalDist` to `newDist`** and **sets `edge.target->prev` to the current `v`**. This process is known as "relaxation".
        - After iterating through all vertices and their edges, it calls `printPath` starting from the last vertex in the `vertices` vector (`vertices.back()`) to print the calculated shortest path to that specific destination.
        - Finally, it calls `reset()` to reinitialize all vertex properties (`isVisited`, `totalDist`, `prev`) for subsequent runs.
    - **`printPath(Vertex * v)`**: A recursive function that traverses the `prev` pointers from a given destination `v` back to the source vertex, printing the path in reverse order, then presenting it as "A --> B --> C" etc..
    - **`reset()`**: Resets all vertices to their initial state: `isVisited` to `false`, `totalDist` to `infinity`, and `prev` to `nullptr`.

### Visual Walkthrough of Dijkstra's Algorithm (Illustrated)

The algorithm can be visually understood using a graph with vertices A through J:

1. **Initialization**: The starting vertex `A` has a `totalDist` of `0`, while all other vertices (B through J) are initialized with `infinity`. The `prev` (or "from") column is initially empty or undefined.
2. **Processing A**: The algorithm starts from `A`. Its neighbors `B`, `C`, and `D` have their `totalDist` updated:
    - `B` = `0` (from A) + `2` (weight A-B) = `2`. `prev` for B is A.
    - `C` = `0` (from A) + `4` (weight A-C) = `4`. `prev` for C is A.
    - `D` = `0` (from A) + `3` (weight A-D) = `3`. `prev` for D is A.
3. **Processing B**: `B` has the smallest current `totalDist` (`2`). From `B`, its neighbors `E`, `F`, `G` are relaxed:
    - `E` = `2` (from B) + `7` (weight B-E) = `9`. `prev` for E is B.
    - `F` = `2` (from B) + `4` (weight B-F) = `6`. `prev` for F is B.
    - `G` = `2` (from B) + `6` (weight B-G) = `8`. `prev` for G is B.
4. **Processing C**: `C` has the next smallest `totalDist` (`4`). From `C`, its neighbors `E`, `F`, `G` are relaxed:
    - `E`: Current `totalDist` is `9`. `4` (from C) + `3` (weight C-E) = `7`. Since `7 < 9`, `E`'s `totalDist` is updated to `7`. `prev` for E is C.
    - `F`: Current `totalDist` is `6`. `4` (from C) + `2` (weight C-F) = `6`. Since `6` is not less than `6`, `F`'s `totalDist` remains `6` and `prev` remains B.
    - `G`: Current `totalDist` is `8`. `4` (from C) + `4` (weight C-G) = `8`. Since `8` is not less than `8`, `G`'s `totalDist` remains `8` and `prev` remains B.
5. **Processing D**: `D` has the next smallest `totalDist` (`3`). From `D`, its neighbors `E`, `F`, `G` are relaxed:
    - `E`: Current `totalDist` is `7`. `3` (from D) + `4` (weight D-E) = `7`. No change.
    - `F`: Current `totalDist` is `6`. `3` (from D) + `1` (weight D-F) = `4`. Since `4 < 6`, `F`'s `totalDist` is updated to `4`. `prev` for F is D.
    - `G`: Current `totalDist` is `8`. `3` (from D) + `5` (weight D-G) = `8`. No change.
6. **Processing E**: `E` has the next smallest `totalDist` (`7`). From `E`, its neighbors `H`, `I` are relaxed:
    - `H` = `7` (from E) + `1` (weight E-H) = `8`. `prev` for H is E.
    - `I` = `7` (from E) + `4` (weight E-I) = `11`. `prev` for I is E.
7. **Processing F**: `F` has the next smallest `totalDist` (`4`). From `F`, its neighbors `H`, `I` are relaxed:
    - `H`: Current `totalDist` is `8`. `4` (from F) + `6` (weight F-H) = `10`. Since `10` is not less than `8`, `H`'s `totalDist` remains `8` and `prev` remains E.
    - `I`: Current `totalDist` is `11`. `4` (from F) + `3` (weight F-I) = `7`. Since `7 < 11`, `I`'s `totalDist` is updated to `7`. `prev` for I is F.
8. **Processing G**: `G` has the next smallest `totalDist` (`8`). From `G`, its neighbors `H`, `I` are relaxed:
    - `H`: Current `totalDist` is `8`. `8` (from G) + `3` (weight G-H) = `11`. No change.
    - `I`: Current `totalDist` is `7`. `8` (from G) + `3` (weight G-I) = `11`. No change.
9. **Processing H**: `H` has the next smallest `totalDist` (`8`). From `H`, its neighbor `J` is relaxed:
    - `J` = `8` (from H) + `3` (weight H-J) = `11`. `prev` for J is H.
10. **Processing I**: `I` has the next smallest `totalDist` (`7`). From `I`, its neighbor `J` is relaxed:
    - `J`: Current `totalDist` is `11`. `7` (from I) + `4` (weight I-J) = `11`. No change, as `11` is not less than `11`.
11. **Final Path to J**: Tracing back `J`'s `prev` pointer (which is `H`), then `H`'s `prev` (which is `E`), then `E`'s `prev` (which is `C`), and `C`'s `prev` (which is `A`), the shortest path from `A` to `J` is **A --> C --> E --> H --> J** with a total distance of **11**.

### Note on Implementation vs. Algorithm

It's important to note that the **`Dijkstra` method provided in the C++ source performs a single pass of relaxation over all edges by iterating through vertices in their input order within the `vertices` vector**. While the source code is presented as "Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm Implementation", and the visual slides correctly demonstrate the iterative selection of the minimum-distance unvisited node (which is a hallmark of Dijkstra's algorithm), the C++ `Dijkstra` function's loop structure (iterating `for(auto & v : vertices)`) does not explicitly incorporate the **priority queue** mechanism typically used in a standard Dijkstra implementation to guarantee that the next vertex processed is always the one with the smallest `totalDist` found so far among unvisited vertices. This simplified implementation might yield correct results for specific graph structures, like the one provided in the example, but it **does not represent a general-purpose, correct Dijkstra's algorithm** for all graph types without multiple iterations or a different processing order.
